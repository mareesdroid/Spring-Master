What are Java Annotaions:
    Special labels/ marekers added to Java Classes
    Provide meta-data about the Classes
    Processed at compile time or run-time for special processing 


Annotation are meta-data about the Class

annotaion example:
    Imagine if you are overriding some method
    and you put annotation label for that overriding method 
    on compile time compiler check this method really override in this class as advertised in annotations
    if not it will not compile and hrow the error

Why Spring configuration with annotations : 
    Annotaton minimize the xml configuration


Spring scanning for component classes for special annotaion
Automaticallt register the beans in spring container(which have annotation)



Development Process
    1.Enable component scanneing in spring config file
    2.Add the @Component Annotation to your Java classes
    3.Retrieve bean from spring container
