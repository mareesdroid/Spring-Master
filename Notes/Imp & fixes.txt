    If u face server startup error like
Several ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Tomcat Server at localhost are already in use

see evernote for solution
    If you are on mac environment, here is what I did.

Find the process id running on this port from terminal, eg, 8080:

lsof -i :8080
and kill it:

kill -9 <PID>
